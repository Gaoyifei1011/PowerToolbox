> * .NET desktop development (install according to Visual Studio tooltip content after opening the solution, .NET Framework SDK version 4.8.1)

#### <p align="center">Compilation steps</p>

Packaged version
> * Clone the project and download the code locally
> * Open the FileRenamer.sln file using Visual Studio 2022, and if the solution prompts that some tools are not installed, open the solution again after completing the installation tool steps.
> * Restore the project's Nuget package.
> * After the restore is complete, right-click FileRenamerPackage, set the project as the startup project, and click Deploy.
> * After the deployment is complete, open the Start menu to run the app.

Unpackaged version
> * Clone the project and download the code locally
> * Open the FileRenamer.sln file using Visual Studio 2022, and if the solution prompts that some tools are not installed, open the solution again after completing the installation tool steps.
> * Restore the project's Nuget package.
> * After the restore is complete, right-click FileRenamerPackage and click Generate (do not deploy).
> * After the FileRenamerPackage project is built, right-click FileRenamer, set the project as the startup project, and click Generate.
  * After the FileRenamer project is built, open the locally generated directory (Relative path: FileRenamer\bin\x64\Debug(Release)\net481\win10-x64), and open the directory generated by the FileRenamerPackage project at the same time (Relative path: FileRenamerPackage\bin\x64\Debug(Release)) , copy the resources.pri file in this directory to the directory generated by the FileRenamer project.
  * After the copy is complete, you can run the unpackaged FileRenamer.exe program.

#### <p align="center">App localization</p>
##### The project was initially available in both Chinese Simplified and English formats, and if you want to translate your app into a language you are familiar with or correct errors in content that has been translated, please refer to the steps below.

> * Look for readme template files in the DeScription folder, for example, the English version is a README_EN-US.md file, rename it to README_(corresponding language).md file.
> * Open the renamed file, translate all the statements and save them. Please check it carefully after the translation is completed.
> * Open the README.md of the project's home page and add your language in the language selection at the top. For example, "English", note that the text is accompanied by a hyperlink.
> * README_ (corresponding language).The language screenshot added in the md file is replaced with the app screenshot in the language you are familiar with.
> * Complete the translation steps described above to ensure that all steps run smoothly.
> * Open the FileRenamerPackage packaging project, find the Package.appxmanifest file, right-click the file, click View Code, find the Sources tab, and add the corresponding language according to the template, such as "<Resource Language="EN-US"/>".
> * Open the Strings folder of the FileRenamer project and create the language you are using, for example ( English (United States) file name is en-us , you can refer to the Table of Indicating Language (Culture) Codes and Countries and Regions)
> * Open the resw file under the subfolder and translate each name.
> * Compile and run the code and test your language, when the application is first opened if there is no language you use to display English (United States) by default, it needs to be dynamically adjusted in the settings.
> * Create a PR after completing the above steps, then submit the modified content to this project and wait for the merge.
